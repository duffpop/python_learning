# Script logic

- Set IT members
- Assign IT members to day of the week
  - Ensuring someone isn't set for more than two days a week
- Set Slack topic
- Message the IT member
- On Saturday, remove the list and re-run for the following week
  - The DM sent to the IT member is then reflected on this stored list
  - Perhaps need to store this to an external list and then send from there?
